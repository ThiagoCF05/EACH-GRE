Familiarity with the objects and colours  also meant that my descriptions got better e.g. a ""ball"" at first and then a ""sphere"".  Likewise a ""square"" as a ""cube"".  In retrospect I wish I had used the word ""adjacent"" rather than ""directly next to"" (its more succinct and accurate)  "12,male,20-25,mathematics or engineering or computing,american,noprobs,easier-no,not-col-blind,10-15, I had to stop for a few minutes around scene 23.14,male,30-40,cognitive science,british,noprobs,easier-no,not-col-blind,under10, I have a psych background (though new to this experiment) so couldn't help but think about the simplest most robust approach. My approach was to use unique identifiers to keep instructions to a minimum only referencing location if I felt there were two or more objects that could be confused. Reference location was relative rather than absolute incase the viewpoint to the friend changed. I thought there could be some objects hidden from view but chose to ignore this for now15,male,30-40,mathematics or engineering or computing,australian,noprobs,easier-yes,not-col-blind,under10,"The first few I added redundant information.

I also decided I didn't need to say ""big"" or ""small"" if there was no other same shape same color (even though that was a little confusing since it was hard to see each picture as isolated from the other pictures).

I started to want to vary my descriptions of essentially similar scenes though to avoid sounding repetitious to the hypothetical listener.Other comment: I kept wanting to type ""box"" rather than ""cube"" because ""box"" goes with ""ball"" (I suppose ""block"" might suit just as well being informal as well).

If there was only one yellow ball I would just say ""yellow ball"" instead of describing its location with respect to the other objects. Sometimes I would describe more then realize there was a more efficient way then say that. Also I was unsure when there was some ambiguity (the small red ball on the right/left) - how could I describe its location with respect to other objects? I found that too complicated so I just said ""on the left/right"".A very interesting study!! Please let me know when you publish or if you want any follow up info/testing."153,female,26-30,languages,american,,easier-yes,not-col-blind,under10, At some point it became easier to describe which object was meant because it was the only object of both its shape and color in the room so all you had to do was identify these two properties and nothing extra about their position related to other objects in the room. But this was not the case throughout the rest of the set.Fun little games to break up my long day!154,female,20-25,mathematics or engineering or computing,australian,noprobs,easier-yes,not-col-blind,under10, It became easier over time as you developed a pattern of comparison of space colours and shape sizes. 155,male,26-30,arts,american,noprobs,easier-maybe,not-col-blind,under10, 156,female,50-60,human or social sciences,american,noprobs,easier-no,not-col-blind,under10," i looked to see whatever made the object unique. that way the instructions could be brief and specific. i hate when people give directions and include alot of extraneous information!

But this time I felt a habitual need to specify color when it was not necessary such that I'd type it as soon as I saw the ball but before actually examining the whole scene and noticing that it was unnecessary.

It always included the shape though ... never a place holder like ""one"""308,male,50-60,languages,british,noprobs,easier-maybe,maybe-col-blind,under10, 309,female,50-60,human or social sciences,american,noprobs,easier-yes,not-col-blind,10-15, I think my answers were more efficient and less wordy as time went on - perhaps that is only my perception310,male,30-40,no college or university education,american,noprobs,easier-no,not-col-blind,under10," was a bit repetitive. Once I settled on ""box"" and ""ball"" for the descriptors of the objects I started to want to flesh out my descriptions even when it was unnecessary just to keep it lively."311,male,26-30,mathematics or engineering or computing,american,noprobs,easier-yes,not-col-blind,under10, It became easier because I used the same conventions for the spatial relation between the indicated object and at least one other object. I kept the same naming convention through out the exercise. ie used large and small through out rather than big or tiny or smaller etc. 312,female,50-60,human or social sciences,american,noprobs,easier-yes,not-col-blind,under10,I started to notice what was necessary to uniquely identify a ball or cube and stopped worrying about whether the perspective made a ball look smaller when it wasn't. When there was a perspective question I used other identifiers. Was interested to note that color and shape were more salient and easy identifiers than relative position313,female,20-25,arts,american,noprobs,easier-yes,not-col-blind,under10,The task got easier when I stopped debating where my interlocutor was supposed to be standing and just resorted to using stage directions pretending that the person understood them.314,male,20-25,mathematics or engineering or computing,australian,noprobs,easier-no,not-col-blind,under10, 315,female,20-25,human or social sciences,australian,noprobs,easier-maybe,not-col-blind,under10, 316,female,26-30,languages,american,noprobs,easier-no,not-col-blind,under10, 317,female,30-40,physical or natural sciences,american,noprobs,easier-yes,not-col-blind,under10, Once I had a system down the experiment felt easier to do though I noticed a definite slow down in my description time when there was a new situation- two objects the same in the picture for instance. The two green boxes one on top of the other felt the longest b/c I had to stop and think how I would describe the top one; it didn't fit in with my naming system. 318,female,20-25,arts,australian,noprobs,easier-no,not-col-blind,under10,319,male,30-40,physical or natural sciences,australian,,easier-yes,not-col-blind,under10, I think it got easier because I got into a rythym of uniquely describing objects.321,male,30-40,languages,american,noprobs,easier-no,not-col-blind,under10, 322,male,over60,mathematics or engineering or computing,american,,,,under10,normal 324,female,20-25,languages,american,noprobs,easier-maybe,not-col-blind,under10,"Halfway through I realized the objects were three dimensional so I started calling the ""squares"" cubes. "325,male,over60,languages,british,noprobs,easier-no,not-col-blind,under10, I felt I chose the minimal identifiction of the objects although I could have specified them more fully. Most often I think I left out location if the object could be identified anyway (because it was the only one of its size colour or shape)326,female,30-40,cognitive science,american,noprobs,easier-no,not-col-blind,under10,
