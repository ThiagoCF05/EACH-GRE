E.g. being 30 I didn't know whether to pick 26-30 or 30-40 since I'm in both ranges. You should make the categories non-overlapping (26-30 31-40 etc.). I chose 26-30 since I figure I'm a young 30 :-)11,female,20-25,human or social sciences,american,noprobs,not-easier,under10, 13,female,30-40,physical or natural sciences,american,noprobs,maybe-easier,under10, 14,female,20-25,physical or natural sciences,american,noprobs,not-easier,under10, 15,male,26-30,mathematics or engineering or computing,american,noprobs,maybe-easier,under10, the number of adjectives i used to describe the thing i was picking up changed over time. of course it took a couple of scenes to realise that there may be better ways of describing exactly which ball/cube we were expected to pick up and that this may in fact be what you were referring to in trying to determine how we identify the objects.16,male,30-40,cognitive science,british,noprobs,not-easier,under10, 17,female,20-25,mathematics or engineering or computing,american,noprobs,maybe-easier,under10, 18,female,20-25,physical or natural sciences,other,noprobs,not-easier,under10, 23,male,30-40,languages,american,noprobs,not-easier,under10," It occurred to me that often locatives wouldn't really be necessary to instruct someone on what to pick up since in many cases the indicated object was the only one of its type in the scene.  So if there was one ball (in focus) and two cubes I normally wouldn't say ""pick up the ball in front of the leftmost cube.""  I'd say ""pick up the ball.""  I tend to overanalyze situations however so I usually included redundant locational information."24,male,26-30,arts,american,noprobs,easier,under10, 25,female,20-25,physical or natural sciences,american,noprobs,not-easier,under10,It was a good distraction from doing my risk assessment.26,female,26-30,cognitive science,other,noprobs,not-easier,under10, 27,male,20-25,mathematics or engineering or computing,american,noprobs,not-easier,under10, 28,female,20-25,languages,american,noprobs,not-easier,under10, 29,female,20-25,human or social sciences,american,noprobs,not-easier,under10, 31,female,20-25,physical or natural sciences,american,noprobs,easier,under10, I realised I was providing superfluous information. Since there is only ever one object in the scene that is both say yellow AND a sphere there is no reason to be more specific. Hang on - did the instructions say be as descriptive as you can? I hope not.32,female,20-25,physical or natural sciences,american,noprobs,not-easier,under10, 33,female,20-25,mathematics or engineering or computing,american,noprobs,easier,under10, i could use a formula34,male,20-25,physical or natural sciences,american,noprobs,not-easier,under10, 35,male,20-25,mathematics or engineering or computing,american,noprobs,not-easier,under10, 36,female,20-25,mathematics or engineering or computing,american,noprobs,easier,under10, It only took me less than one minute actually.  I couldn't help analysing my answers quickly after I'd written them but I didn't change them.  It affected my subsequent answers though.  Eg after it suddenly occured to me that I hadn't been referring to the colours at all then I started doing it.37,male,30-40,physical or natural sciences,american,noprobs,not-easier,under10, I reckon it took under 30sec for the exercise plus 20 or so sec to fill in this stuff. Good luck with it babe!38,male,26-30,human or social sciences,american,noprobs,easier,under10," As time passed I found I was able to ""capture"" the information required to specify the required object more efficiently but I still included more than minimal info in most cases to make it as easy as possible for the listener."39,male,30-40,mathematics or engineering or computing,american,noprobs,maybe-easier,under10, 40,female,26-30,mathematics or engineering or computing,american,noprobs,maybe-easier,under10, 41,female,20-25,physical or natural sciences,american,noprobs,not-easier,under10, 42,male,20-25,mathematics or engineering or computing,american,noprobs,not-easier,under10, Hi Jette!  Hope you're doing well!  Let me know how the study goes!44,male,30-40,mathematics or engineering or computing,british,noprobs,maybe-easier,under10, Just appeared tiresome45,male,20-25,languages,american,noprobs,not-easier,under10, 46,female,30-40,human or social sciences,american,noprobs,not-easier,under10, 47,male,20-25,mathematics or engineering or computing,american,noprobs,not-easier,under10, 48,male,50-60,mathematics or engineering or computing,american,noprobs,easier,under10,Task got easier as I was able to create a template for describing which object to pick up.49,female,26-30,arts,american,noprobs,easier,under10,At first I was inclined to give more information than necessary. The task got easier when I only gave the minimum information necessary for my friend to understand me. 51,male,20-25,mathematics or engineering or computing,american,noprobs,not-easier,under10,"my response were very much instinct - so i wasn't necessary consistent (eg saying ""Small box"" when it was the only box in the particular scene)"52,male,20-25,mathematics or engineering or computing,american,noprobs,not-easier,under10,If only i had my weighted companion cube....53,female,26-30,mathematics or engineering or computing,other,noprobs,not-easier,under10," I speak ""Canadian"" english"54,male,26-30,cognitive science,american,noprobs,easier,under10,"Increased ease. I realised that I need to say just a shape failing that a colour and a shape and at most a colour shape and size (always ""small"")"55,male,26-30,no college or university education,other,noprobs,not-easier,under10, It was too easy.56,male,26-30,physical or natural sciences,american,noprobs,easier,under10, It got easy because I realized the boundary of things that changed (size color arrangement)57,male,40-50,mathematics or engineering or computing,american,noprobs,maybe-easier,under10, 58,male,20-25,languages,american,noprobs,not-easier,under10, 59,female,20-25,arts,australian,noprobs,not-easier,under10, 60,male,20-25,mathematics or engineering or computing,australian,noprobs,easier,under10," I developed a pattern in my mind to describe the colour and shape of the object. Much like in the form of ""[Colour] [Size] [Shape]"" omitting the size where possible."61,male,20-25,physical or natural sciences,australian,noprobs,maybe-easier,under10,63,male,16-20,physical or natural sciences,australian,noprobs,not-easier,under10, 64,female,30-40,human or social sciences,british,techprobs,easier,under10," Technical problem: The page timed out as I submitted it and I had to ""try again"". The task got easier as the tasks were quite similiar to each other."65,female,26-30,mathematics or engineering or computing,australian,noprobs,easier,under10,The task became easier as you became familiar with the colours shapes and sizes available: these constraints limit the possible combinations to be presented and thus expected.66,female,20-25,arts,american,noprobs,easier,under10,I thought about it more at first but then realized how simple the answers really were. 67,male,20-25,arts,american,noprobs,easier,10---15,it got easier because it came down to a system69,male,20-25,mathematics or engineering or computing,american,noprobs,easier,under10,Previous choices influenced later ones.  For example in one example I used color to discriminate between two objects and I then used color in the next example despite there being no need for it.  If I had done the second example before the first I would not have used color.  Also I did not use spatial relations (eg 'on top of the box') because color shape and size alone were enough to distinguish the objects.  Had there been two objects of the same color shape and size I would have used spatial relations.70,male,30-40,arts,australian,noprobs,not-easier,under10, 71,female,20-25,physical or natural sciences,british,noprobs,maybe-easier,under10, I think you said to write cube but I forgot and wrote box.72,female,26-30,human or social sciences,british,noprobs,maybe-easier,under10,Dont think I responded very consistently - sometimes i noted the colour other times the shape and other times the  position (and sometimes all three).  Also probably put in more detail than was necessary74,male,over60,arts,american,noprobs,easier,under10,
